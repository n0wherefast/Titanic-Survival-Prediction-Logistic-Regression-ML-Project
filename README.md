## 📖 Introduction

This notebook-based project explores the famous **Kaggle Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival using **Logistic Regression**.

It covers the full **data science pipeline**:
1. Data loading & cleaning  
2. Feature engineering  
3. Model training with class balancing  
4. Evaluation (accuracy, recall, F1, confusion matrix)  
5. Explainability using **SHAP**  
6. Interactive prediction for new passengers  

This project is ideal as a **portfolio example** of applied data science and model interpretability.
